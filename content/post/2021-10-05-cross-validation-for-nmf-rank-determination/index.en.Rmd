Finding the optimal rank for NMF is challenging. Unlike PCA or SVD where interesting factors have high singular values, NMF factors are colinearly optimized.

Several cross-validation methods for NMF have been proposed, yet here we find only a single method that performs well.

## Gridded cross-validation

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
