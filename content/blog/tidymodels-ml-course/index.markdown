Today I am happy to announce that a new [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/)-centric version of my free, online, interactive course, [**Supervised Machine Learning: Case Studies in R**](https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.com/), has been published! üéâ

![](/figs/2019-09-23-supervised-ml-course/ml-course.png)

This is at least the third version of this course I've built at this point üòÅ but I believe it to be the best, in terms of how it communicates machine learning concepts and how useful to your real-world problems the demonstrated code will be. Huge thanks to my RStudio teammates such as Alison Hill and Max Kuhn for their feedback during the editing process! Similar to [the last time I launched this course](https://juliasilge.com/blog/supervised-ml-course/), it provides four case studies using data from the real world for you to practice your predictive modeling skills.

## Supervised machine learning in R

One question we sometimes field from R users is about choosing to use tidymodels vs. caret. The original version of my course mostly used caret, and caret is a stable and broadly used framework for modeling and machine learning in R. Although new development for our team is focused on tidymodels and I personally am spending my time only on tidymodels projects, I know that there may be folks out there who want to learn from the original version of the course. The original, caret-centric version of the course [will continue to be available at a different URL](https://caret-ml-course.netlify.app/).

Revamping this course, built on the amazing framework created by [Ines Montani](https://ines.io/), yet again has given me an opportunity to revisit the course development process and reflect on what I've learned. I have a post for the [RStudio Education blog](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/) in the works, and will publish that soon. 

The back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org). It can take a little while for Binder to spin up a new Docker container the first time you run a code exercise in a new session, so be patient when that happens! ‚è≥

## Try it out

As the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) ecosystem continues to develop, we are excited to have more resources for folks looking to learn, whether that's [articles on getting started](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) or a [course like mine](https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.com/). Contributions and comments on how to improve my course are welcome! Please [file an issue](https://github.com/juliasilge/supervised-ML-case-studies-course/issues) or submit a pull request if you find something that could be fixed or improved.
