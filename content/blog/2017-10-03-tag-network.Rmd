I have a [new post on the Stack Overflow blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/03/mapping-ecosystems-software-development/) today about the complex, interrelated ecosystems of software development. On the data team at Stack Overflow, we spend a lot of time and energy thinking about tech ecosystems and how technologies are related to each other. One way to get at this idea of relationships between technologies is **tag correlations**, how often technology tags at Stack Overflow appear together relative to how often they appear separately. One place we see developers using tags at Stack Overflow is on their [Developer Stories](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/join). If we are interested in how technologies are connected and how they are used together, developers' own descriptions of their work and careers is a great place to get that.

I released the data for this network structure as a [dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-tag-network/) so you can explore it for yourself! For example, the post for Stack Overflow includes an interactive visualization created using the [networkD3](https://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/) package but we can create other kinds of visualizations using the [ggraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph) package. Either way, trusty [igraph](http://igraph.org/r/) comes into play.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
library(readr)
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)

stack_network <- graph_from_data_frame(read_csv("stack_network_links.csv"),
                                       vertices = read_csv("stack_network_nodes.csv"))

set.seed(2017)
ggraph(stack_network, layout = "fr") +
    geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.2, aes(width = value)) +
    geom_node_point(aes(color = as.factor(group), size = 10 * nodesize)) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label = name), family = "RobotoCondensed-Regular",
                   repel = TRUE) +
    theme_graph(base_family = "RobotoCondensed-Regular") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(family="Roboto-Bold"),
          legend.position="none") +
    labs(title = "Stack Overflow Tag Network",
         subtitle = "Tags correlated on Developer Stories")
```

We have explored these kinds of network structures using all kinds of data sources at Stack Overflow, from Q&A to traffic, and although we see similar relationships across all of them, we really like Developer Stories as a data source for this particular question. Let me know if you have any comments or questions!
