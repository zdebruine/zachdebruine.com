Lately I've been publishing [screencasts](https://juliasilge.com/category/tidymodels/) demonstrating how to use the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework, starting from just getting started. Today's screencast explores a more advanced topic in how to tune an XGBoost classification model using with this week's [`#TidyTuesday` dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) on beach volleyball. `r emo::ji("volleyball")`

Here is the code I used in the video, for those who prefer reading instead of or in addition to video.


## Explore the data

Our modeling goal is to predict whether a beach volleyball team of two won their match based on [game play stats like errors, blocks, attacks, etc from this week's #TidyTuesday dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-05-19/readme.md) . This dataset is quite extensive so it's a great opportunity to try a more powerful machine learning algorithm like XGBoost. This model has lots of tuning parameters!


```{r}
vb_matches <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-19/vb_matches.csv', guess_max = 76000)

vb_matches
```

This dataset has the match stats like serve errors, kills, and so forth divided out by the two players for each team, but we want those combined together because we are going to make a prediction **per team** (i.e. what makes a team more likely to win). Let's include predictors like gender, circuit, and year in our model along with the per-match statistics. Let's omit matches with `NA` values because we don't have all kinds of statistics measured for all matches.

```{r}
vb_parsed <- vb_matches %>%
  transmute(
    circuit,
    gender,
    year,
    w_attacks = w_p1_tot_attacks + w_p2_tot_attacks,
    w_kills = w_p1_tot_kills + w_p2_tot_kills,
    w_errors = w_p1_tot_errors + w_p2_tot_errors,
    w_aces = w_p1_tot_aces + w_p2_tot_aces,
    w_serve_errors = w_p1_tot_serve_errors + w_p2_tot_serve_errors,
    w_blocks = w_p1_tot_blocks + w_p2_tot_blocks,
    w_digs = w_p1_tot_digs + w_p2_tot_digs,
    l_attacks = l_p1_tot_attacks + l_p2_tot_attacks,
    l_kills = l_p1_tot_kills + l_p2_tot_kills,
    l_errors = l_p1_tot_errors + l_p2_tot_errors,
    l_aces = l_p1_tot_aces + l_p2_tot_aces,
    l_serve_errors = l_p1_tot_serve_errors + l_p2_tot_serve_errors,
    l_blocks = l_p1_tot_blocks + l_p2_tot_blocks,
    l_digs = l_p1_tot_digs + l_p2_tot_digs
  ) %>%
  na.omit()
```

Still plenty of data! Next, let's create separate dataframes for the winners and losers of each match, and then bind them together. I am using functions like `rename_with()` from the [upcoming dplyr 1.0 release here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/05/dplyr-1-0-0-last-minute-additions/).

```{r}
winners <- vb_parsed %>%
  select(circuit, gender, year,
         w_attacks:w_digs) %>%
  rename_with(~ str_remove_all(., "w_"), w_attacks:w_digs) %>%
  mutate(win = "win")

losers <- vb_parsed %>%
  select(circuit, gender, year,
         l_attacks:l_digs) %>%
  rename_with(~ str_remove_all(., "l_"), l_attacks:l_digs) %>%
  mutate(win = "lose")

vb_df <- bind_rows(winners, losers) %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, factor)

```

This is a similar [data prep approach to Joshua Cook](https://twitter.com/JoshDoesa/status/1262738031636672516).

Exploratory data analysis is always important before modeling. Let's make one plot to explore the relationships in this data.

```{r}
vb_df %>%
  pivot_longer(attacks:digs, names_to = "stat", values_to = "value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(gender, value, fill = win, color = win)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.4) +
  facet_wrap(~stat, scales = "free_y", nrow = 2) +
  labs(y = NULL, color = NULL, fill = NULL)
```

We can see differences in errors and blocks especially. There are lots more great examples of #TidyTuesday EDA out there to explore on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TidyTuesday)!

## Build a model

We can start by loading the tidymodels metapackage, and splitting our data into training and testing sets.

```{r}
library(tidymodels)

set.seed(123)
vb_split <- initial_split(vb_df, strata = win)
vb_train <- training(vb_split)
vb_test <- testing(vb_split)
```

An XGBoost model is based on trees, so we don't need to do much preprocessing for our data; we don't need to worry about the factors or centering or scaling our data. Let's just go straight to setting up our model specification. Sounds great, right? On the other hand, we are going to tune **a lot** of model hyperparameters.

```{r}
xgb_spec <- boost_tree(
  trees = 1000, 
  tree_depth = tune(), min_n = tune(), 
  loss_reduction = tune(),                     ## first three: model complexity
  sample_size = tune(), mtry = tune(),         ## randomness
  learn_rate = tune(),                         ## step size
) %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

xgb_spec
```

YIKES. `r emo::ji("weary")` Well, let's set up possible values for these hyperparameters to try. Let's use a space-filling design so we can cover the hyperparameter space as well as possible.

```{r}
xgb_grid <- grid_latin_hypercube(
  tree_depth(),
  min_n(),
  loss_reduction(),
  sample_size = sample_prop(),
  finalize(mtry(), vb_train),
  learn_rate(),
  size = 30
)

xgb_grid
```

Notice that we had to treat `mtry()` differently because it depends on the actual number of predictors in the data.

Let's put the model specification into a workflow for convenience. Since we don't have any complicated data preprocessing, we can use `add_formula()` as our data preprocessor.

```{r}
xgb_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_formula(win ~ .) %>%
  add_model(xgb_spec)

xgb_wf
```

Next, let's create cross-validation resamples for tuning our model.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
vb_folds <- vfold_cv(vb_train, strata = win)

vb_folds
```

IT'S TIME TO TUNE. We use `tune_grid()` with our tuneable workflow, our resamples, and our grid of parameters to try. Let's use `control_grid(save_pred = TRUE)` so we can explore the predictions afterwards.

```{r}
doParallel::registerDoParallel()

set.seed(234)
xgb_res <- tune_grid(
  xgb_wf,
  resamples = vb_folds,
  grid = xgb_grid,
  control = control_grid(save_pred = TRUE)
)

xgb_res
```

This takes a while to finish on my computer (and makes my fans run!) but we did it. `r emo::ji("muscle")`

## Explore results

We can explore the metrics for all these models.

```{r}
collect_metrics(xgb_res)
```

We can also use visualization to understand our results.

```{r}
xgb_res %>%
  collect_metrics() %>%
  filter(.metric == "roc_auc") %>%
  select(mean, mtry:sample_size) %>%
  pivot_longer(mtry:sample_size,
               values_to = "value",
               names_to = "parameter"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(value, mean, color = parameter)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~parameter, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "AUC")
```

Remember that we used a space-filling design for the parameters to try. It looks like higher values for tree depth were better, but other than that, the main thing I take away from this plot is that there are several combinations of parameters that perform well.

What are the best performing sets of parameters?

```{r}
show_best(xgb_res, "roc_auc")
```

There may have been lots of parameters, but we were able to get good performance with several different combinations. Let's choose the best one.

```{r}
best_auc <- select_best(xgb_res, "roc_auc")
best_auc
```

Now let's finalize our tuneable workflow with these parameter values.

```{r}
final_xgb <- finalize_workflow(
  xgb_wf,
  best_auc
)

final_xgb
```

Instead of `tune()` placeholders, we now have real values for all the model hyperparameters.

What are the most important parameters for [variable importance](https://koalaverse.github.io/vip/)?

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
library(vip)

final_xgb %>%
  fit(data = vb_train) %>%
  pull_workflow_fit() %>%
  vip(geom = "point")
```

The predictors that are most important in a team winning vs. losing their match are the number of kills, errors, and attacks. There is almost no difference between the two circuits, and very little difference by gender.

It's time to go back to the testing set! Let's use `last_fit()` to _fit_ our model one last time on the training data and _evaluate_ our model one last time on the testing set. Notice that this is the first time we have used the testing data during this whole modeling analysis.

```{r}
final_res <- last_fit(final_xgb, vb_split)

collect_metrics(final_res)
```

Our results here indicate that we did not overfit during the tuning process. We can also create a ROC curve for the testing set.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
final_res %>%
  collect_predictions() %>%
  roc_curve(win, .pred_win) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = 1 - specificity, y = sensitivity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5, color = "midnightblue") +
  geom_abline(
    lty = 2, alpha = 0.5,
    color = "gray50",
    size = 1.2
  )
```
