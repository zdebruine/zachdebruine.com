Lately I've been publishing [screencasts](https://juliasilge.com/category/tidymodels/) demonstrating how to use the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework, from just getting started to tuning more complex models. Today's screencast explores how to fluently apply tidy data principles to the task of building many models using with this week's [`#TidyTuesday` dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) on crop yields. ðŸŒ½

Here is the code I used in the video, for those who prefer reading instead of or in addition to video.

## Explore the data

Our modeling goal is to estimate how [crops yields are changing around the world using this week's #TidyTuesday dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/readme.md). We can build many models for the country-crop combinations we are interested in.

First, let's read in two of the datasets for this week.


```r
library(tidyverse)

key_crop_yields <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/key_crop_yields.csv")
land_use <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-01/land_use_vs_yield_change_in_cereal_production.csv")
```

I'm going to use the `land_use` dataset only to find the top population countries. Let's create a vector of their names.


```r
top_countries <- land_use %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(code), entity != "World") %>%
  group_by(entity) %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  slice_max(total_population_gapminder, n = 30) %>%
  pull(entity)

top_countries
```

```
##  [1] "China"                        "India"                       
##  [3] "United States"                "Indonesia"                   
##  [5] "Pakistan"                     "Brazil"                      
##  [7] "Nigeria"                      "Bangladesh"                  
##  [9] "Russia"                       "Mexico"                      
## [11] "Japan"                        "Ethiopia"                    
## [13] "Philippines"                  "Egypt"                       
## [15] "Vietnam"                      "Democratic Republic of Congo"
## [17] "Germany"                      "Turkey"                      
## [19] "Iran"                         "Thailand"                    
## [21] "United Kingdom"               "France"                      
## [23] "Italy"                        "South Africa"                
## [25] "Tanzania"                     "Myanmar"                     
## [27] "Kenya"                        "South Korea"                 
## [29] "Colombia"                     "Spain"
```

Now let's create a tidy version of the crop yields data, for the countries and crops I am interested in.


```r
tidy_yields <- key_crop_yields %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(wheat_tonnes_per_hectare:bananas_tonnes_per_hectare,
    names_to = "crop", values_to = "yield"
  ) %>%
  mutate(crop = str_remove(crop, "_tonnes_per_hectare")) %>%
  filter(
    crop %in% c("wheat", "rice", "maize", "barley"),
    entity %in% top_countries,
    !is.na(yield)
  )

tidy_yields
```

```
## # A tibble: 6,032 x 5
##    entity     code   year crop   yield
##    <chr>      <chr> <dbl> <chr>  <dbl>
##  1 Bangladesh BGD    1961 wheat  0.574
##  2 Bangladesh BGD    1961 rice   1.70 
##  3 Bangladesh BGD    1961 maize  0.799
##  4 Bangladesh BGD    1961 barley 0.577
##  5 Bangladesh BGD    1962 wheat  0.675
##  6 Bangladesh BGD    1962 rice   1.53 
##  7 Bangladesh BGD    1962 maize  0.738
##  8 Bangladesh BGD    1962 barley 0.544
##  9 Bangladesh BGD    1963 wheat  0.607
## 10 Bangladesh BGD    1963 rice   1.77 
## # â€¦ with 6,022 more rows
```

This data structure is just right for plotting **crop yield over time**!


```r
tidy_yields %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, yield, color = crop)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.7, size = 1.5) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~entity, ncol = 5) +
  scale_x_continuous(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "yield (tons per hectare)")
```

Notice that not all countries produce all crops, but that overall crop yields are _increasing_.


## Many models

Now let's fit a linear model to each country-crop combination.


```r
library(tidymodels)

tidy_lm <- tidy_yields %>%
  nest(yields = c(year, yield)) %>%
  mutate(model = map(yields, ~ lm(yield ~ year, data = .x)))

tidy_lm
```

```
## # A tibble: 111 x 5
##    entity     code  crop   yields            model 
##    <chr>      <chr> <chr>  <list>            <list>
##  1 Bangladesh BGD   wheat  <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
##  2 Bangladesh BGD   rice   <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
##  3 Bangladesh BGD   maize  <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
##  4 Bangladesh BGD   barley <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
##  5 Brazil     BRA   wheat  <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
##  6 Brazil     BRA   rice   <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
##  7 Brazil     BRA   maize  <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
##  8 Brazil     BRA   barley <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
##  9 China      CHN   wheat  <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
## 10 China      CHN   rice   <tibble [58 Ã— 2]> <lm>  
## # â€¦ with 101 more rows
```


Next, let's `tidy()` those models to get out the coefficients, and adjust the p-values for multiple comparisons while we're at it.


```r
slopes <- tidy_lm %>%
  mutate(coefs = map(model, tidy)) %>%
  unnest(coefs) %>%
  filter(term == "year") %>%
  mutate(p.value = p.adjust(p.value))

slopes
```

```

```


## Explore results

Now we can visualize the results of this modeling, which is estimating how crop yields are changing around the world.


```r
library(ggrepel)
slopes %>%
  ggplot(aes(estimate, p.value, label = entity)) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 0, lty = 2,
    size = 1.5, alpha = 0.7, color = "gray50"
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = crop), alpha = 0.8, size = 2.5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  facet_wrap(~crop) +
  geom_text_repel(size = 3, family = "IBMPlexSans") +
  theme_light(base_family = "IBMPlexSans") +
  theme(strip.text = element_text(family = "IBMPlexSans-Bold", size = 12)) +
  labs(x = "increase in tons per hectare per year")
```

- On the x-axis is the slope of these models. Notice that most countries are on the positive side, with increasing crop yields. The further to the right a country is, the larger the increase in crop yield over this time period. Corn yields have increased the most.

- On the y-axis is the p-value, a measure of how surprising the effect we see is under the assumption of no relationship (no change with time). Countries lower in the plots have smaller p-values; we are more certain those are real relationships.

We can extend this to check out how well these models fit the data with `glance()`. This approach for using statistical models to estimate changes in many subgroups at once has been so helpful to me in many situations!
