Lately I've been publishing [screencasts](https://juliasilge.com/category/tidymodels/) demonstrating how to use the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework, from first steps in modeling to how to evaluate complex models. Today's screencast focuses on using bootstrap resampling with this week's [`#TidyTuesday` dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) from the [Claremont Run Project](http://www.claremontrun.com/) about issues of the comic book series Uncanny X-Men. ðŸ¦¸

Here is the code I used in the video, for those who prefer reading instead of or in addition to video.


## Read in the data

Our modeling goal is to use information about speech bubbles, thought bubbles, narrative statements, and character depictions [from this week's #TidyTuesday dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-06-30/readme.md) to understand more about characteristics of individual comic book issues. Let's focus on two modeling questions.

- Does a given issue have the X-Mansion as a location?
- Does a given issue pass the [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test)?

We're going to use three of the datasets from this week.


```r
library(tidyverse)

character_visualization <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-06-30/character_visualization.csv")
xmen_bechdel <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-06-30/xmen_bechdel.csv")
locations <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-06-30/locations.csv")
```

The `character_visualization` dataset counts up each time one of the main 25 character speaks, thinks, is involved in narrative statements, or is depicted total.


```r
character_visualization
```

```
## # A tibble: 9,800 x 7
##    issue costume character                     speech thought narrative depicted
##    <dbl> <chr>   <chr>                          <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
##  1    97 Costume Editor narration                   0       0         0        0
##  2    97 Costume Omnipresent narration              0       0         0        0
##  3    97 Costume Professor X = Charles Xavierâ€¦      0       0         0        0
##  4    97 Costume Wolverine = Logan                  7       0         0       10
##  5    97 Costume Cyclops = Scott Summers           24       3         0       23
##  6    97 Costume Marvel Girl/Phoenix = Jean Gâ€¦      0       0         0        0
##  7    97 Costume Storm = Ororo Munroe              11       0         0        9
##  8    97 Costume Colossus = Peter (Piotr) Rasâ€¦      9       0         0       17
##  9    97 Costume Nightcrawler = Kurt Wagner        10       0         0       17
## 10    97 Costume Banshee = Sean Cassidy             0       0         0        5
## # â€¦ with 9,790 more rows
```

Let's aggregate this dataset to the issue level so we can build models using per-issue differences in speaking, thinking, narrative, and total depictions.


```r
per_issue <- character_visualization %>%
  group_by(issue) %>%
  summarise(across(speech:depicted, sum)) %>%
  ungroup()

per_issue
```

```
## # A tibble: 196 x 5
##    issue speech thought narrative depicted
##    <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>
##  1    97    146      13        71      168
##  2    98    172       9        29      180
##  3    99    105      22        29      124
##  4   100    141      28         7      122
##  5   101    158      27        58      191
##  6   102     78      27        33      133
##  7   103     91       6        25      121
##  8   104    142      15        25      165
##  9   105     83      12        24      128
## 10   106     20       6        20       16
## # â€¦ with 186 more rows
```

I'm not doing a ton of EDA here but there are lots of great examples out there to explore on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TidyTuesday)!

## Which issues have the X-Mansion as a location?

Let's start with our first model. The X-Mansion is the most frequently used location, but it does not appear in every episode.


```r
x_mansion <- locations %>%
  group_by(issue) %>%
  summarise(mansion = "X-Mansion" %in% location)

locations_joined <- per_issue %>%
  inner_join(x_mansion)

locations_joined %>%
  mutate(mansion = if_else(mansion, "X-Mansion", "No mansion")) %>%
  pivot_longer(speech:depicted, names_to = "visualization") %>%
  mutate(visualization = fct_inorder(visualization)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(mansion, value, fill = visualization)) +
  geom_dotplot(
    binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center",
    binpositions = "all",
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~visualization, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    x = NULL, y = NULL,
    title = "Which issues contain the X-Mansion as a location?",
    subtitle = "Comparing the top 25 characters' speech, thought, narrative portrayal, and total depictions",
    caption = "Data from the Claremont Run Project"
  )
```

Now let's create bootstrap resamples and fit a logistic regression model to each resample. What are the bootstrap confidence intervals on the model parameters?


```r
library(tidymodels)
set.seed(123)
boots <- bootstraps(locations_joined, times = 1000, apparent = TRUE)

boot_models <- boots %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(
      splits,
      ~ glm(mansion ~ speech + thought + narrative + depicted,
        family = "binomial", data = analysis(.)
      )
    ),
    coef_info = map(model, tidy)
  )

boot_coefs <- boot_models %>%
  unnest(coef_info)

int_pctl(boot_models, coef_info)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 6
##   term          .lower .estimate    .upper .alpha .method   
##   <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>     
## 1 (Intercept) -2.42     -1.29    -0.277      0.05 percentile
## 2 depicted     0.00193   0.0103   0.0196     0.05 percentile
## 3 narrative   -0.0106    0.00222  0.0143     0.05 percentile
## 4 speech      -0.0148   -0.00716  0.000617   0.05 percentile
## 5 thought     -0.0143   -0.00338  0.00645    0.05 percentile
```

How are the parameters distributed?


```r
boot_coefs %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  mutate(term = fct_inorder(term)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(estimate, fill = term)) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 0, color = "gray50",
    alpha = 0.6, lty = 2, size = 1.5
  ) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, bins = 25, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~term, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "Which issues contain the X-Mansion as a location?",
    subtitle = "Comparing the top 25 characters' speech, thought, narrative portrayal, and total depictions",
    caption = "Data from the Claremont Run Project"
  )
```

<img src="/blog/uncanny-xmen/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="2400" />

- Issues with more depictions of the main 25 characters (i.e. large groups of X-Men) are more likely to occur in the X-Mansion.
- Issues with more speech bubbles from these characters are less likely to occur in the X-Mansion.

Apparently issues with lots of talking are more likely to occur elsewhere!

## Now let's do the Bechdel test

If you haven't heard about the Bechdel test, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLF6sAAMb4s) (now over 10 years old!) is a nice explainer. We can use the same approach from the previous section but replace the data about issue locations with the Bechdel test data.


```r
bechdel_joined <- per_issue %>%
  inner_join(xmen_bechdel) %>%
  mutate(pass_bechdel = if_else(pass_bechdel == "yes", TRUE, FALSE))

bechdel_joined %>%
  mutate(pass_bechdel = if_else(pass_bechdel, "Passes Bechdel", "Fails Bechdel")) %>%
  pivot_longer(speech:depicted, names_to = "visualization") %>%
  mutate(visualization = fct_inorder(visualization)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pass_bechdel, value, fill = visualization)) +
  geom_dotplot(
    binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center",
    binpositions = "all",
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~visualization, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    x = NULL, y = NULL,
    title = "Which Uncanny X-Men issues pass the Bechdel test?",
    subtitle = "Comparing the top 25 characters' speech, thought, narrative portrayal, and total depictions",
    caption = "Data from the Claremont Run Project"
  )
```

<img src="/blog/uncanny-xmen/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="2400" />

We can again create bootstrap resamples, fit logistic regression models, and compute bootstrap confidence intervals.


```r
set.seed(123)
boots <- bootstraps(bechdel_joined, times = 1000, apparent = TRUE)

boot_models <- boots %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(
      splits,
      ~ glm(pass_bechdel ~ speech + thought + narrative + depicted,
        family = "binomial", data = analysis(.)
      )
    ),
    coef_info = map(model, tidy)
  )

boot_coefs <- boot_models %>%
  unnest(coef_info)

int_pctl(boot_models, coef_info)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 x 6
##   term           .lower .estimate    .upper .alpha .method   
##   <chr>           <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>     
## 1 (Intercept) -1.18      -0.248    0.699      0.05 percentile
## 2 depicted    -0.0232    -0.0111  -0.000509   0.05 percentile
## 3 narrative   -0.00405    0.00966  0.0260     0.05 percentile
## 4 speech       0.00521    0.0151   0.0285     0.05 percentile
## 5 thought      0.000561   0.0155   0.0361     0.05 percentile
```

How are _these_ parameters distributed?


```r
boot_coefs %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  mutate(term = fct_inorder(term)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(estimate, fill = term)) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 0, color = "gray50",
    alpha = 0.6, lty = 2, size = 1.5
  ) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, bins = 25, show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~term, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "Which Uncanny X-Men issues pass the Bechdel test?",
    subtitle = "Comparing the top 25 characters' speech, thought, narrative portrayal, and total depictions",
    caption = "Data from the Claremont Run Project"
  )
```

<img src="/blog/uncanny-xmen/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="2400" />

- Issues with more depictions of the main 25 characters (i.e. more characters in them) are less likely to pass the Bechdel test.
- Issues with more speech bubbles from these characters are more likely to pass the Bechdel test. (Perhaps also issues with more thought bubbles.)

I think it makes sense that issues with lots of speaking are more likely to pass the Bechdel test, which is about characters speaking to each other. Interesting that the issues with lots of character depictions are _less_ likely to pass!
