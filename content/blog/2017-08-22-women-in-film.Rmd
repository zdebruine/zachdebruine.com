I was so glad to work with the talented [Russell Goldenberg](https://twitter.com/codenberg) and [Amber Thomas](https://twitter.com/proquesasker) on this project, and many thanks to [Matt Daniels](https://twitter.com/matthew_daniels) for inviting me to contribute to [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/). I've been a big fan of their work for a long time!
