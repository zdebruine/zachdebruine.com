My name is Zach DeBruine and I am an Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics at [Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu) and Adjunct Professor at the [Van Andel Institute](https://www.vai.org/). I work in the [Department of Computing](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/) and the [Applied Computing Institute]([https://vari.vai.org/epigenetics/](https://www.gvsu.edu/aci/)) where my lab develops methods for analysis of single-cell experiments.

I developed the general-purpose [Rcpp Machine Learning Library (RcppML)](https://github.com/zdebruine/RcppML) R package around my implementation of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which is the world's fastest and most flexible implementation of the method. This blog is my sandbox for trying new things, sharing stuff I've learned, and testing stuff I've built.

This blog is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
