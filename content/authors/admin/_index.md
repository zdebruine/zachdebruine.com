My name is Zach DeBruine and I am a postdoctoral fellow in bioinformatics at the [Van Andel Institute](https://www.vai.org/). I work in the [Center for Epigenetics](https://vari.vai.org/epigenetics/) within the [Triche Lab](https://trichelab.vai.org/) where I develop methods for analysis of single-cell experiments. I love simple, fast, and common sense data analysis.

I developed the general-purpose [Rcpp Machine Learning Library (RcppML)](https://github.com/zdebruine/RcppML) R package for non-negative factorization and clustering. This blog is my sandbox for trying new things, sharing stuff I've learned, and testing stuff I've built.

This blog is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
